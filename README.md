本项目是中山大学新学生活动中心的源代码

它是我大二的时候写出来的，现在看来，这个代码是质量很差的。如果换做今天，我会使用spring+hibernate+stucts去写。这些框架对于一个大二的学生来说，有点遥远。

The source code for http://sac.sysu.edu.cn

The project is written when i was a sophomore student.

Of course, the project is full of bugs. But it runs in the server for several years stably.

Now I will open the source.

The project simply contains two parts. Backend and Frontend.

Backend runs in tomcat or jetty. 

Frontend is just simply html using ajax communicate with backend.

In nowadays, I will use spring+hibernate+stucts to write it. But it was two hard for a sophomore student to use the framwork.
